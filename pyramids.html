    The Egyptian pyramids are ancient masonry structures located in Egypt. Most were built as tombs for the pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods. At least 138 identified pyramids have been discovered in Egypt.
    <br><br>The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built.[9] The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest Egyptian pyramid and the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence, despite being the oldest by about 2,000 years

            <td>The Great Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops) is the largest and most famous of the pyramids in Giza, Egypt. It was built during the Fourth Dynasty around 2580–2560 BC for the Pharaoh Khufu. Originally standing at 146.6 meters (481 feet), it was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years. The pyramid is made of about 2.3 million limestone blocks, each weighing between 2.5 to 15 tons. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today. Despite being over 4,500 years old, the structure remains a symbol of ancient Egyptian engineering and mystery</td>

Khafre is best known for building the second largest pyramid at Giza, which stands next to his father’s Great Pyramid. His pyramid complex also includes the Great Sphinx of Giza, which is believed to have his face carved on it.
