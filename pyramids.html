    The Egyptian pyramids are ancient masonry structures located in Egypt. Most were built as tombs for the pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods. At least 138 identified pyramids have been discovered in Egypt.
    <br>
    <br>The designations of the pyramids—Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure—correspond to the kings for whom they were built. The northernmost and oldest pyramid of the group was built for Khufu (Greek: Cheops), the second king of the 4th dynasty. Called the Great Pyramid, it is the largest of the three, the length of each side at the base averaging 755.75 feet (230 meters) and its original height being 481.4 feet (147 meters). The middle pyramid was built for Khafre (Greek: Chephren), the fourth of the eight kings of the 4th dynasty; the structure measures 707.75 feet (216 meters) on each side and was originally 471 feet (143 meters) high. The southernmost and last pyramid to be built was that of Menkaure (Greek: Mykerinus), the fifth king of the 4th dynasty; each side measures 356.5 feet (109 meters), and the structure’s completed height was 218 feet (66 meters). All three pyramids were plundered both internally and externally in ancient and medieval times. Thus, the grave goods originally deposited in the burial chambers are missing, and the pyramids no longer reach their original heights because they have been almost entirely stripped of their outer casings of smooth white limestone; the Great Pyramid, for example, is now only 451.4 feet (138 meters) high. That of Khafre retains the outer limestone casing only at its topmost portion. Constructed near each pyramid was a mortuary temple, which was linked via a sloping causeway to a valley temple on the edge of the Nile floodplain. Also nearby were subsidiary pyramids used for the burials of other members of the royal family.

            <td>The Great Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops) is the largest and most famous of the pyramids in Giza, Egypt. It was built during the Fourth Dynasty around 2580–2560 BC for the Pharaoh Khufu. Originally standing at 146.6 meters (481 feet), it was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years. The pyramid is made of about 2.3 million limestone blocks, each weighing between 2.5 to 15 tons. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today. Despite being over 4,500 years old, the structure remains a symbol of ancient Egyptian engineering and mystery</td>

            <td>Khafre (also spelled Khefren) was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom. He was the son of Khufu and ruled around 2558–2532 BC. Khafre is best known for building the second largest pyramid at Giza, which stands next to his father’s Great Pyramid. His pyramid complex also includes the Great Sphinx of Giza, which is believed to have his face carved on it. Khafre continued the tradition of powerful centralized rule and contributed to the development of ancient Egyptian art and architecture.</td>

        <td>Pyramid of Menkaure</td>
        <td>Menkaure was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom. He was the son of Khafre and the grandson of Khufu. Menkaure is best known for building the third and smallest of the three main pyramids at Giza. Although his pyramid is smaller, it is considered to be more detailed and carefully constructed. Menkaure was known as a kind and just ruler, and he is often remembered positively in ancient texts. His reign helped continue the legacy of the powerful Fourth Dynasty.
