                    Egypt is considered one of the oldest 
                    civilizations in history, emerging along the banks 
                    of the Nile River more than seven thousand years ago. 
                    The ancient Egyptians left behind a magnificent legacy of monuments, such as the pyramids, temples, and royal tombs,
                    which continue to amaze the world to this day. These monuments reflect their brilliance 
                    in engineering, art, and science.
