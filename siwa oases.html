                Siwa Oasis is a magical and peaceful place located in the heart of Egypt’s Western Desert, about 300 km southwest of Marsa Matrouh.
                The oasis is famous for its natural beauty — from golden sand dunes to clear water springs and salt lakes that reflect the sky like a mirror.
                Siwa is also home to important historical sites such as the Temple of Amun, which was visited by Alexander the Great.
                Siwa is not just a place — it's a unique experience full of calmness, beauty, and untouched nature.
                Siwa Oasis is a very unique place in Egypt.
